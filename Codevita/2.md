## Jugs and Cups

Consider a jug of capacity L litres. Given N cups of different capacities Ci (in litres), fill the jug
with the help of cups, according to the specifications. The specifications according to which the cups may be used to fill the jug are as follows-
1. Cous can be used integral number of times i.e. zero or more times, but never partially i.e. a cup of 1L can be used 0,1,2 etc times but not 0.5, 1.5...
2. The jug must not overflow because of the cup filling the jug.
3. The number of distinct cups(i.e. different cup sizes) used to fill the jug must be maximized.
4. The summation of number of times all cups are used must be minimized.
5. Consider point 3 to be more important than point 4 when aiming to meet the optimization goals.

### Input:
First line of the input contains N representing the number of cups. The N numbers follow representing the weight of each cup. And last line conatins the capacity 
of the jug.

### Output:
Output consists of two lines.
First line must comprise of N or less space delimited integers, in ascending order of the cup size, for the cups used to fill the jug.
Second line must comprise of equal number of space delimitedintegers which denote the frequency i.e. the number of times the corresponding cup int he firest line is used to fill the Jug.

### Time : 1s
### Example
```
//Input
4
3 7 10 11
88
//Output

3 7 10 11
1 2 6 1

//Explanation:
The first and second lines indicate that you are provided with 4 cups of capacities -3 litres, 7 litres, 10 litres and 11 litres. The third line indicate the capacity of the jug is 88 litres.
One possible solution for filling the jug is

7 10 11
5 2 3
i.e. one cup uses 7L cup for 5 times to get 35l. Next one can use the 10L cup twice. After that the jug will contain 55L. Finally, one can use the 11L cup thrice.
Thus the jug will be filled. However, this situation uses cups of only 3 different capacities when four different capacties are available. Hence the jug is perhapsnot filled
according to specifications. let's see if we can achieve our objective by using all 4 cup sizes.

We can use all the available cups if we use them as follows
3 7 10 11
1 2  6  1

Hence, this is our final solution which adheres to the specifications.


```

```
Input:
3
2 5 10
50

Output:
2 5 10 
5 2 3

//Explanation:
Solution 1:
2 5 10
15 2 1
Solution 2:
2 5 10
5 2 3

Both solutions use all available cups. However, sum of frequencies in Solution 1 is 18(15+2+1), whereas sum of frequencies in Solution 2 is 10(5+2+3). oltution 2 minimizes 
the summation of number of times any cup is used.This is alse a requirement as per the specifications. Hence solution 2 is the correct answer.
