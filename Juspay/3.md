### Problem Statement

The first line is a number  which is the number of people in the social network. The next following lines are the actual members of the social network whose names are 
written in separate lines. Following that is the number of connections, followed to y a new line separated list of connections given as <follower><following>.
Then on the next line is the id of the person who wants to our React Expert(A) and on the next ine is the id of the person who is the newbie(B).
  
Output should be a stored set of ids of persons whom A should block to prevent B from sending messages to him. -1 if there is no such member to be blocked.

  Input:
  4
  2
  5
  7
  9
