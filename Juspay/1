### Problem Statement

Members can send messages to each other only if they are connected through common connections. Find if the message can reach 
the recipitent int he given configuration of the social network. The social network is given as input in the following form. The first line is the number which is the 
number of people in the social network. And following that is the actual members of the social network whose names(or id's) are written 
in separated lines. Following that is the number of direct connections, followed by a new line separated list of connections  given space separated.
Then on the next line is the person who wants to send the message and on the next line is the person who is the intended recipient.

The output should be a single line considering of either 1 if the message can reach the intended recipient or 0 otherwise.

```
Input:
4
2
5
7
9
4
2 9
7 2
7 9
Output:
1

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> adj[5001];
bool visited[5001];
bool dfs(int start, int end)
{
if(start == end)
return true;

visited[start] = 1;
for(auto x: adj[start]){
    if(!visited[x])
    if(dfs(x,end))
    return true;
}
return false;
}



int main(){
int n;
cin>>n;
vector<int> members;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
   int x;
   cin>>x;
   members.push_back(x);
   
   }
   int end;
   cin>>end;
   for(int i=0;i<end;i++){
       int x,y;
       cin>>x>>y;
       adj[x].push_back(y);
   }
   int n1, n2;
   cin>>n1>>n2;
   if(dfs(n1,n2)){
     cout<<"1";
   }else{
      cout<<"0";
   }
  return 0; 
}
```
