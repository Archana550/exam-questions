### Problem Statement

In this problem, each person in the social network takes a specific time to send the message. A specific newbie in react wants to post a 
question to a ninja on the network. Find out how long a specific message takes to reach ninja from newbie. The social network is given as the input as follows.
The first line is a number which is the number of people in the social network. The next following lines are the actual members of the social network whose names 
are written in space separated lines. Following that is the number of connections, followed by a new line separeated list of connections given as
<followe><following time><time it takes to send the message>. Then on the next line is the person who wants to send the message and 
  on the next line is the person who is the intended recipient.
  
  The output should be a single line consisting of the time it takes to send the message through or -1 if the message can't be sent.
  
  ```
  Input:
  4
  2
  5
  7
  9
  4
  2 9 2
  7 2 3
  7 9 7
  9 5 1
  7

  output:
  5
