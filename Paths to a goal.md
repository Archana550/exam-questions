## Problem Statement
   Given a number line from 0 to n and a string denoting a sequence of moves, determine the number of sequence of moves that lead from a given 
   point x to end at another point y. Moves will be given as a sequence of l and r instructions. An instruction l= left movement, so from position j the new 
   position j the new position is j-1, and an instruction r= right movement, so from position j instruction r= right movement, so from position j the new position would    be j+1.
